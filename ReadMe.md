## Getting Started

Import this lightweight package to your project (or manually add the script to an Editor folder in the Assets folder), and youâ€™re ready to zip!

To use it:
1. Simply select "Export Project to Zip..." from the file menu. 
2. If your project or your scene needs saving, you will be prompted to save (optional).
3. Then choose the name and location for the Zip file. 
4. Sit back and watch the progress bar as the compression is done (can be cancelled).

That's it!

## Technical Details

* Integrates directly in the file menu
* Detects if scene or project needs saving
* Adds only the required project files to the archive\*
* Compression can be cancelled
* Compatible with both Mac and Windows
* No additional software needed

\* Excludes all zip files at the top level of the project, and also excludes the following folders: .git, Library, Logs, Obj, Temp. An exception to excluding the Library folder is the LastSceneManagerSetup.txt file, which is included to allow Unity to remember and load the last accessed scene when the project is reopened. Note that other Library files can be recreated by Unity.

## Compatibility

Tested on Mac and Windows with Unity versions 2021.3.16 (LTS), 2022.1.11 and 2022.2.1.
Projects larger than 8 GB were compressed successfully.

## Known Issues

* Progress bar could be more responsive when compressing (Unity editor bug).
* If the project contains large files, the export may take a long time.

## About the Project

I created this tool to help my students move their Unity projects between computers and to make it easier for them to hand in their assignments. As a teacher, I noticed that the huge size of the Library folder in a Unity project can be difficult to manage for new users. While the Library folder can be recreated if deleted, it is not an intuitive process for those unfamiliar with Unity. 

This tool simplifies Unity project transfer and submission, making it easier for my students to focus on learning and creating. It can also be useful for seasoned game developers!

I hope this script helps you to improve your workflow and make it more efficient.
