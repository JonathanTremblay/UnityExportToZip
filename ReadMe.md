## Getting Started

Import this lightweight package to your project (or manually add the scripts to an Editor folder in the Assets folder), and youâ€™re ready to zip!

To use it:
1. Simply select "Export Project to Zip..." from the file menu (Ctrl+Alt+S). 
2. If your project or your scene needs saving, you will be prompted to save (optional).
3. Then choose the name and location for the Zip file. 
4. Sit back and watch the progress bar as the compression is done (can be cancelled).

That's it!

## Technical Details

* Integrates directly in the file menu
* Detects if scene or project needs saving
* Adds only the required project files to the archive\*
* Compression can be cancelled
* Compatible with both Mac and Windows
* No additional software needed

\* Excludes all zip files at the top level of the project, and also excludes the following folders: .git, Build/Builds folders (this can be changed in Project Settings), Library, Logs, Obj, Temp. However, it preserves two files from the Library folder: LastSceneManagerSetup.txt (which stores the last accessed scene) and EditorUserBuildSettings.asset (which stores the build settings). Note that other Library files can be recreated by Unity.

## Compatibility

Tested on Mac and Windows with Unity versions 2022.3.6 (LTS), 2021.3.16 (LTS), 2022.2.1 and 2022.1.11.
Projects larger than 8 GB were compressed successfully.

## Known Issues

* The progress bar could be more responsive when compressing (Unity editor bug).
* If the project contains large files, the export may take a long time.

## About the Project

I created this tool to help my students move their Unity projects between computers and to make it easier for them to hand in their assignments. As a teacher, I noticed that the huge size of the Library folder in a Unity project can be difficult to manage for new users. While the Library folder can be recreated if deleted, it is not an intuitive process for those unfamiliar with Unity. 

This tool simplifies the transfer and submission of Unity projects, making it easier for my students to focus on learning and creating. It can also be useful for seasoned game developers!
